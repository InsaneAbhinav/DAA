# Complexities and Recurrence Relations

1. Sum of n Natural Numbers

   - Recurrence Relation: T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(n)

2. Fibonacci Numbers

   - Recurrence Relation: T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + O(1)
   - Time Complexity: O(2^n)
   - Space Complexity: O(n)

3. Binary Search

   - Recurrence Relation: T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1)
   - Time Complexity: O(log n)
   - Space Complexity: O(log n)

4. Factorial of a Number

   - Recurrence Relation: T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)
   - Time Complexity:  O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(n) 

5. Delete a Linked List

   - Recurrence Relation: T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1) 
   - Time Complexity:  O(n) 
   - Space Complexity: O(n)
